# Data Analysis Portfolio: SQL, C# .NET, Azure

This portfolio demonstrates simple projects that use a .NET framework and C# code to connect to and query Azure SQL databases. Screenshots of outputs are included in .png files.

## AzureSQLTest.cs

A starting test of the code to connect to and query an Azure SQL database, later expanded to interrogate the data via various SQL SELECT queries and display the answers to set questions. The dataset used is the AdventureWorks sample database.

## AzureSQL-DDL-DML.cs

A small demonstration of taking a collection of CSV files and turning them into a database. 

## WrecksData.cs (IN PROGRESS)

Investigating the Wrecks_and_Obstructions_Text_File, available from https://datahub.admiralty.co.uk under the Open Goverment License (https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).
